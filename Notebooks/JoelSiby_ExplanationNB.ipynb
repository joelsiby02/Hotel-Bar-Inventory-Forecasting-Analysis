    "## 1) Core Business Problem (and why it matters)\n",
    "\n",
    "A growing hotel chain operates multiple bars across different locations. They are currently facing two major inventory challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stockouts of high-demand items (fast movers)**  \n",
    "  When popular brands run out, the bar cannot serve guests, which directly reduces revenue and negatively impacts guest satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overstocking of slow-moving items (slow movers)**  \n",
    "  When low-demand items are overstocked, it increases holding costs, ties up capital, and increases the risk of waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business goal\n",
    "Build a system that helps managers decide:\n",
    "\n",
    " **How much of each brand should each bar keep, and when should they reorder?**\n"

    "## 2. Assumptions Made (and Why)?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Daily aggregation of demand**  \n",
    "The raw data is transaction-level (timestamp included). I aggregated consumption into daily demand per **Bar × Alcohol Type × Brand** because forecasting and inventory planning require consistent daily time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Missing days treated as zero demand**  \n",
    "If a bar-brand combination had no record on a day, I assumed demand was **0** for that day. This is necessary to model intermittent demand correctly and avoid biasing forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Lead time assumed as 2 days**  \n",
    "The dataset does not provide supplier delivery lead time. I assumed a realistic **2-day lead time** to simulate ordering and replenishment delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Service level fixed at 95% (z = 1.65)**  \n",
    "I assumed a **95% service level** to balance stockout risk and holding cost. This reflects a common business tradeoff for hospitality inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Bottle ordering constraint (750 ml)**  \n",
    "Since alcohol is typically replenished in bottles, I assumed orders must be placed in **750ml multiples**. This makes the simulation more realistic and explains why inventory sometimes exceeds the Par level.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Stable operating conditions**  \n",
    "The model assumes normal bar operations and does not explicitly account for rare events like closures, strikes, or one-time large events. These would require external signals such as hotel occupancy or event calendars.\n"

    "### Forecasting goal\n",
    "Forecast daily item-level demand (**Consumed (ml)**) for each **Bar × Alcohol Type × Brand** time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models tested (baseline forecasting)\n",
    "I tested two simple and explainable baseline forecasting approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **MA7 (Rolling 7-day Moving Average)**  \n",
    "   Forecast = average demand of the last 7 days\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Seasonal Naive (7-day lag)**  \n",
    "   Forecast = demand from the same day last week\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why MA7 was chosen\n",
    "Using a time-based split and MAE evaluation across all 96 bar-brand series:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MA7 performed better in 69 series (~72%)**\n",
    "- **Seasonal naive performed better in 27 series (~28%)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates demand is noisy and intermittent, so MA7 is a stronger default baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not more complex models?\n",
    "I did not use ARIMA/Prophet/XGBoost/Deep Learning because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the dataset is relatively small (~6.5k rows)\n",
    "- demand is intermittent with many zero-demand days\n",
    "- the goal is a practical, explainable system rather than heavy model complexity\n",
